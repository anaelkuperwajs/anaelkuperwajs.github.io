# About Me

I am currently a rising senior at Macalester College (St. Paul, MN), set to graduate in 2021 with a B.A. in computer science and mathematics (applied mathematics and statistics), and a concentration in cognitive science. I am passionate about interdiscplinary computer science research that lies at the intersection of all my personal interests, cs, cognitive science, and education. My excitement comes from the hope that I can make the field of computer science a more open, inclusive, and diverse space for all people willing to take on the challenge.

# Research

I have participated in two REU programs that have shaped my academic path.

## Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (Summer 2019)

## Macalester College (Summer 2018)
